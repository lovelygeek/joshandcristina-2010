This was the WordPress site I created for our wedding. It was active from 2009-2010, the year we planned our wedding. Eventually there was no need to constantly run WordPress updates all the time, so I used a plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/">WP Static HTML Output</a> to convert the entire site to static HTML.
